\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

We have studied three different parametrization of f(R) gravity in this paper.
1) f(R) gravity with one parameter $B_o$ related to the compton scattering length.
2) sclar-tensot chameleon type theory
3) Linder's parametrization.

@Alessandra: could you please fill in detail about the above three models as we discussed.
